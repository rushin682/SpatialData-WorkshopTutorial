## Basics to SpatialData. 

Following are a couple of links that will be useful to get read when you do this workshop:
- [Getting Started: ](https://hackmd.io/@H4hV3IuYTB2j4wt28GwHVQ/HkVxBnUnyx) (Requires signing up on HackMD)
- [Installation:](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/installation.html) (Install spatialdata[extra]) preferably in a private environment.
- [Sandbox](https://github.com/giovp/spatialdata-sandbox.git) to download example samples
- [Detailed documentation](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/index.html)


Couple of pointers:
- Segmentation tool - In Progress [TBD]
- Visium example - In Progress [TBD]
- Visium-Xenium Alignment Tutorial - In Progress [TBD]

Suggestions:
- Don't change the naming of outputs of Xenium/Visium components. Instead perform naming modifications to the directory where all outputs of the Xenium/Visium are stored.
- For example: Don't rename Visium scalefactors_json.json to <samplename>_scalefactors_json.json. Instead update the name of the folder.
